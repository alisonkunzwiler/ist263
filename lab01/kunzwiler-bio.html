    Alison Kunzwiler 

I am a data analytics major with a minor in architecture, interested in exploring how data ethics and responsible data use can create meaningful impact. This year I was a Department of Defense SMART scholar and following graduation, I will be working as a data analyst with the US Army Test and Evaluation Command. With a strong sense of creativity, I have always enjoyed personal art projects in my free time, or more recently experimenting with cooking recipes. I value personal relationships and appreciate collaboration, inviting diverse perspectives in all aspects of my life.
